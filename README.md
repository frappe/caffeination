### Caffeine

Frappes are usually not caffeinated enough, we want a lot of caffeine in ours.

### Goal

This project has only one goal: **Speedup Frappe ecosystem by approximately by 2x.**

Approximately, this boils down to:
- Set up a good benchmark suite ranging from microbenchmarks to realistic traces.
- Remove unnecessary overheads wherever possible. Every 0.1% on critical path counts.
- Make deployments resource efficient by tuning various knobs.
