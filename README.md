### Caffeine

Frappes are usually not caffeinated enough, we want a lot of caffeine in ours.

### Goal

This project has only one goal: **Speedup Frappe ecosystem by approximately by 2x.**

Approximately, this boils down to:
- Set up a good benchmark suite ranging from microbenchmarks to realistic traces.
- Optimize EVERYTHING. Every 0.1% on critical path counts.
- Make deployments resource efficient by tuning various knobs.

### Running Benchmarks

This project uses [pyperf](https://pyperf.readthedocs.io/) to write various micro-benchmarks. Follow these steps to run the benchmarks:
1. Install the app as usual: `bench get-app caffeine`
3. Create a fresh site that hasn't been altered: `bench new-site bench.localhost`
4. Allow running tests on this site: `bench --site bench.localhost set-config allow_tests true`
5. Run benchmarks `bench --site bench.localhost run-microbenchmarks`

Note: It can take up to an hour to run these benchmarks. The time requirement will only go up with more benchmarks.

Additional arguments:
- `--filter=benchmark_name` can be used to filter benchmarks
- `--help` will show you help about pyperf's inbuilt arguments. Refer [pyperf docs](https://pyperf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runner.html) for more info.
- Important pyperf commands:
   - `-p5` can be used for a quick and dirty benchmark run consisting of only 5 outer runs.
   - `-o output.json` can be used to store detailed results for analysis later.
   - `pyperf compare_to` compares two results and applies statistical significance tests.
   - `pyperf timeit` is useful for measuring tiny operations like setting an attribute on an object.

#### Getting reliable results

Your local setup might not be fit for benchmarking. Follow these steps before running benchmarks:

0. Use a Linux machine. We don't run our servers on a Mac, so benchmarking on a Mac is sub-optimal. 
1. Stop all unnecessary running processes. Even your browser.
2. If you're using a laptop, then plug it in. Do NOT benchmark on battery power.
3. Disable SMT (HyperThreading) - `echo "off" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control`
4. Disable turbo boost. This is dependent on your CPU make and kernel version.
5. Use `performance` governor. - [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling) 
6. Disable ASLR - `echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`

This should get you roughly +/- 1% standard deviation results.
